            <p> The backbone of the MySmartSA application is Web Architecture. All designed interfaces
                will respond to different screen sizes of devices and different browsers and will run well on any mobile
                phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop. This project integrates security into agile software
                development. Some practical solutions are suggested, like integrating a static analysis tool into an
                IDE, performing dependency/open-source security checks whenever possible, and configuring
                dynamic test tools into CI/CD pipelines during development and testing. While the automation of security
                checks at each stage of the agile process is
                desired, rolling out security practices at some levels is also recommended. To dynamically respond to
                changing demands and to ensure the protection of riderâ€™s personal data and privacy, web app development
                for this project
                practices agile development with the integration of security. The security testing
                adapts the recommended security roadmap without a SAST vendor for CD/CI.

                <h5>Development Methodology</h5>
                <p>'Providing Real-Time Bus Arrivals' be implemented with Google Maps Platform web
                    services. Google Maps' JavaScript API are the main APIs to retrieve the latest Maps and Routes in
                    the
                    development, where real-time traffic conditions are constantly updated with routes. Directions for
                    transit are obtained by Direction API, and Distance Matrix API is used to calculate travel times
                    based on
                    real-time traffic and distance for multiple stops on a route. Utilizing these APIs, we can
                    conveniently build
                    customized transit maps to fit our project needs. With some exceptions, the mobile web app routes
                    are
                    considered faster and cheaper than the native iOS or Android mobile app routes that use iOS or
                    Android
                    SDK. The Javascript API is chosen for this project because of its capability to enable map controls
                    and gestures for any mobile devices running on web browsers, to provide directions services with
                    realtime
                    traffic information using a form of public transit, and their exclusive support of transit layer
                    with
                    public transport routes, and easy integration with other transit web sites.
