                <p> The backbone of the MySmartSA application is Web Architecture. All designed interfaces
                    will respond to different screen sizes of devices and different browsers and will run well on any mobile
                    phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop. This project integrates security into agile software
                    development. Some practical solutions are suggested, like integrating a static analysis tool into an
                    IDE, performing dependency/open-source security checks whenever possible, and configuring
                    dynamic test tools into CI/CD pipelines during development and testing. While the automation of security checks at each stage of the agile process is
                    desired, rolling out security practices at some levels is also recommended. To dynamically respond to
                    changing demands and to ensure the protection of riderâ€™s personal data and privacy, web app development for this project
                    practices agile development with the integration of security. The security testing
                    adapts the recommended security roadmap without a SAST vendor for CD/CI.

                        <p>'Providing Real-Time Bus Arrivals' be implemented with Google Maps Platform web
                            services. Google Maps' JavaScript API are the main APIs to retrieve the latest Maps and Routes in the
                            development, where real-time traffic conditions are constantly updated with routes. Directions for
                            transit are obtained by Direction API, and Distance Matrix API is used to calculate travel times based on
                            real-time traffic and distance for multiple stops on a route. Utilizing these APIs, we can conveniently build
                            customized transit maps to fit our project needs. With some exceptions, the mobile web app routes are
                            considered faster and cheaper than the native iOS or Android mobile app routes that use iOS or Android
                            SDK. The Javascript API is chosen for this project because of its capability to enable map controls
                            and gestures for any mobile devices running on web browsers, to provide directions services with realtime
                            traffic information using a form of public transit, and their exclusive support of transit layer with
                             public transport routes, and easy integration with other transit web sites.
