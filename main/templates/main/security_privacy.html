                   <p>Security testing for this project is based on threat
                    models that candidate attackers may use to
                    interrupt the application and its functions.
                    We will consider all types of attacks and
                    build security testing experiments
                    throughout the development of the
                    SmartSAT app. The security team will
                    develop an up-to-date threat model, conduct
                    static analysis and a dependency check,
                    setup a monthly SAST scan and configure a
                    regularly scheduled dynamic scan. We will
                    adopt different state of the assessment
                    models and standards and conduct intrusive
                    and non-intrusive security tests. We will use an agile test-driven approach to ensure the app's modules are
                    thoroughly tested at each stage of development.

                            <p>In every testing model, the following steps are involved: <br>
                             (1) Testing security goals will be identified based on specific security target goals derived from security
                                goals (e.g., Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability: CIA), threat models (e.g., Microsoft STRIDE
                                threat model) or specific testing tools. <br>
                            (2) Test cases will be generated, executed, and verified as to whether they pass or fail.<br>
                            (3) After each test, security goals will be reevaluated. Cycles will be repeated until goals are met. <br>
                            (4) We aim to eliminate all known vulnerabilities and have all test cases passed on their expected goals. </p>

                            <p> Users data privacy and user authentication are very important for mobile/web applications. We will protect the user's private data by encryption and protecting the encryption keys using
                                solutions like Web Crypto API, which provides cryptographic functions to JavaScript web apps. Also, we
                                propose a lightweight crypto algorithm to secure private user data in the developed web application. In
                                terms of the user's authentication, we will provide a multi-factor authentication process and force strong
                                passwords usage, accruing to best practices.
